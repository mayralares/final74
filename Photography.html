<h3>Photography is a form of art that caught my attention since a young age
(and by young I mean 12 years old). I enjoyed taking pretty pictures of the
world around me and of my family and it is still a hobby I love doing. At times I'd play with toy cars and create a
whole city with my imagination by using furniture, cups, books and anything that
was available. Until I went out to explore the world more did I decide to
focus on nature. The categories listed bellow are the things I enjoy taking
pictures of the most.</h3>
