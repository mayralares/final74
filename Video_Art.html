  <h3>Video art is art that most people probably know about really well by now. because
  it's all around on Youtube (I mean that's what Youtube is all about right?). Youtubers
  create and post content for others to see. What I didn't know before was that I <head>
  been creating video art all throughout highschool through all the video assignments
  assigned! Video art is really inspiring for me, because it's very do-able in the sense
  that everyone can record content. As of now, the only video I have available is a 51
  second short video.
  <br>
  It's titled 'A Frozen World' and was inspired by my observation of the world around me.
  I noticed how buildings, the sky, and clouds (for the most part) stayed still. Except
  the rest of the world around such as cars, people, wind blowing flags, and so on, moved.
  I don't know why, but I found that a really relaxing concept and decided to do something
  similar with a little twist.</h3>
